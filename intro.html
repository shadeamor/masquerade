    <P class="body-text">Cain was said to have been cursed by God with a vampiric state for murdering his brother.
  He was able to pass on his cursed state to others, thereby, making them like himself only
  somewhat weaker. These first childer, known as the second generation, were said to have been
  made to keep him company, and they in turn made the third generation. The third generation
  were according to legend the founders of the thirteen original clans. According to the old
  ones, all of these vampires lived in peace under Cain's rule in the legendary city known as
  Enoch, or the First City. When God caused the Great Flood, however, the city was destroyed and
  Cain disappeared, leaving his Childer to fend for themselves. The third generation eventually
  rose up and slew their sires. Cain, upon discovering this, cursed them. Cain's curse was
  different for each of the thirteen that rose up and the ultimatly reason for the different
  abilities and curses the thirteen clans have. According to legend, for no one alive now truelly
  knows what happened so long ago. Even immortals fall..<br><br>

  The Camarilla know this and organised the Masquerade. Convinced that the general public must
  not know of the existence of Vampires, for if they knew, the Kindred would all be hunted until
  exterminated... it has happened before and without the Masquerade it will happen again.</p>
